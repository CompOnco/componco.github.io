Creating a favicon
--------------------------

Found a handy free and brilliant website  http://www.html-kit.com/favicon/

Very easy, upload an image and its does the rest.  It generates the .ico file and even a rotating icon !! It even gives you previews of the images on the web. Very nice

I attach both the .ico and the animated .gif file. 

According to the website we now need to:
   1. Upload favicon.ico and animated_favicon1.gif to your web site. These files are in the favicon package you've downloaded.
   2. Add following HTML tags to your web page after the <head> tag but before the </head> tag:
      <link rel="shortcut icon" href="favicon.ico">
      <link rel="icon" type="image/gif" href="animated_favicon1.gif">

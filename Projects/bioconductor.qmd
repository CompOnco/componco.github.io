[Bioconductor](www.bioconductor.org) is an open source, open development software project in the R statistical software language and is widely used in bioinformatics, immunology, microbiology and single-cell genomics. Over 1,200 developers have contributed software that has been [downloaded by users over 42 million times](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/stats/bioc/index.html) by more than 1 million distinct IP addresses, in 2022. In April 2020, we established a Community Advisory Board (CAB) that includes elected representatives from America, Europe, Africa, Asia and Latin America to outreach to the growing global Bioconductor community. The CAB identified accessible high-quality training materials and delivery methods as an urgent, impactful need. Fundamental components for a successful training platform include skilled and effective program management, excellence in instruction, quality of training materials and equity in access. This proposal will redevelop the Bioconductor web presence to ensure Bioconductor communities have equitable access to quality, well-structured, project information and training materials. This work will also deliver structured, high-quality, culturally-aware, inclusive global training by developing a platform for community led instruction.

# Funding Sources

This project is funded by a [Chan Zuckerberg Initiative](https://chanzuckerberg.com/eoss/proposals/bioconductor-high-quality-training-and-support-for-a-worldwide-community/) CZI Science Essential Open Source Software (EOSS) award to Aedin Culhane. As an open source community we are working with [ELIXIR](https://elixir-europe.org/) and [LERO](https://lero.ie)'s open source office.

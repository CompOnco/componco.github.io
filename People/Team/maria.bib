  abstract = {There is an ongoing explosion of scientific datasets being generated, brought on by recent technological advances in many areas of the natural sciences. As a result, the life sciences have become increasingly computational in nature, and bioinformatics has taken on a central role in research studies. However, basic computational skills, data analysis, and stewardship are still rarely taught in life science educational programs, resulting in a skills gap in many of the researchers tasked with analysing these big datasets. In order to address this skills gap and empower researchers to perform their own data analyses, the Galaxy Training Network (GTN) has previously developed the Galaxy Training Platform (https://training.galaxyproject.org), an open access, community-driven framework for the collection of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) training materials for data analysis utilizing the user-friendly Galaxy framework as its primary data analysis platform. Since its inception, this training platform has thrived, with the number of tutorials and contributors growing rapidly, and the range of topics extending beyond life sciences to include topics such as climatology, cheminformatics, and machine learning. While initially aimed at supporting researchers directly, the GTN framework has proven to be an invaluable resource for educators as well. We have focused our efforts in recent years on adding increased support for this growing community of instructors. New features have been added to facilitate the use of the materials in a classroom setting, simplifying the contribution flow for new materials, and have added a set of train-the-trainer lessons. Here, we present the latest developments in the GTN project, aimed at facilitating the use of the Galaxy Training materials by educators, and its usage in different learning environments.},

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Seurat is one of the most popular software suites for the analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing data. Considering the popularity of the tidyverse ecosystem, which offers a large set of data display, query, manipulation, integration, and visualisation utilities, a great opportunity exists to interface the Seurat object with the tidyverse. This interface gives the large data science community of tidyverse users the possibility to operate with familiar grammar.
RESULTS: To provide Seurat with a tidyverse-oriented interface without compromising efficiency, we developed tidyseurat, a lightweight adapter to the tidyverse. Tidyseurat displays cell information as a tibble abstraction, which allows intuitively interfacing Seurat with dplyr, tidyr, ggplot2 and plotly packages powering efficient data manipulation, integration, and visualisation. Iterative analyses on data subsets are enabled by interfacing with the popular nest-map framework.
AVAILABILITY: The software is freely available at cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyseurat/ and github.com/stemangiola/tidyseurat.
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The vast ecosystem of single-cell RNA-sequencing tools has until recently been plagued by an excess of diverging analysis strategies, inconsistent file formats, and compatibility issues between different software suites. The uptake of 10x Genomics datasets has begun to calm this diversity, and the bioinformatics community leans once more towards the large computing requirements and the statistically driven methods needed to process and understand these ever-growing datasets.
RESULTS: Here we outline several Galaxy workflows and learning resources for single-cell RNA-sequencing, with the aim of providing a comprehensive analysis environment paired with a thorough user learning experience that bridges the knowledge gap between the computational methods and the underlying cell biology. The Galaxy reproducible bioinformatics framework provides tools, workflows, and trainings that not only enable users to perform 1-click 10x preprocessing but also empower them to demultiplex raw sequencing from custom tagged and full-length sequencing protocols. The downstream analysis supports a range of high-quality interoperable suites separated into common stages of analysis: inspection, filtering, normalization, confounder removal, and clustering. The teaching resources cover concepts from computer science to cell biology. Access to all resources is provided at the singlecell.usegalaxy.eu portal.
CONCLUSIONS: The reproducible and training-oriented Galaxy framework provides a sustainable high-performance computing environment for users to run flexible analyses on both 10x and alternative platforms. The tutorials from the Galaxy Training Network along with the frequent training workshops hosted by the Galaxy community provide a means for users to learn, publish, and teach single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis.},

  abstract = {The RNA polymerase II (POLII)-driven transcription cycle is tightly regulated at distinct checkpoints by cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and their cognate cyclins. The molecular events underpinning transcriptional elongation, processivity, and the CDK-cyclin pair(s) involved remain poorly understood. Using CRISPR-Cas9 homology-directed repair, we generated analog-sensitive kinase variants of CDK12 and CDK13 to probe their individual and shared biological and molecular roles. Single inhibition of CDK12 or CDK13 induced transcriptional responses associated with cellular growth signaling pathways and/or DNA damage, with minimal effects on cell viability. In contrast, dual kinase inhibition potently induced cell death, which was associated with extensive genome-wide transcriptional changes including widespread use of alternative 3' polyadenylation sites. At the molecular level, dual kinase inhibition resulted in the loss of POLII CTD phosphorylation and greatly reduced POLII elongation rates and processivity. These data define substantial redundancy between CDK12 and CDK13 and identify both as fundamental regulators of global POLII processivity and transcription elongation.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Ovarian fibromas and adenofibromas are rare ovarian tumours. They are benign tumours composed of spindle-like stromal cells (pure fibroma) or a mixture of fibroblast and epithelial components (adenofibroma). We have previously shown that 40% of benign serous ovarian tumours are likely primary fibromas due to the neoplastic alterations being restricted to the stromal compartment of these tumours. We further explore this finding by comparing benign serous tumours to pure fibromas.
RESULTS: Performing copy number aberration (CNA) analysis on the stromal component of 45 benign serous tumours and 8 pure fibromas, we have again shown that trisomy of chromosome 12 is the most common aberration in ovarian fibromas. CNAs were more frequent in the pure fibromas than the benign serous tumours (88% vs 33%), however pure fibromas more frequently harboured more than one CNA event compared with benign serous tumours. As these extra CNA events observed in the pure fibromas were unique to this subset our data indicates a unique tumour evolution. Gene expression analysis on the two cohorts was unable to show gene expression changes that differed based on tumour subtype. Exome analysis did not reveal any recurrently mutated genes.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Familial cases of appendiceal mucinous tumours (AMTs) are extremely rare and the underlying genetic aetiology uncertain. We identified potential predisposing germline genetic variants in a father and daughter with AMTs presenting with pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP) and correlated these with regions of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in the tumours.
METHODS: Through germline whole exome sequencing, we identified novel heterozygous loss-of-function (LoF) (i.e. nonsense, frameshift and essential splice site mutations) and missense variants shared between father and daughter, and validated all LoF variants, and missense variants with a Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion (CADD) scaled score of ≥10. Genome-wide copy number analysis was performed on tumour tissue from both individuals to identify regions of LOH.
RESULTS: Fifteen novel variants in 15 genes were shared by the father and daughter, including a nonsense mutation in REEP5. None of these germline variants were located in tumour regions of LOH shared by the father and daughter. Four genes (EXOG, RANBP2, RANBP6 and TNFRSF1B) harboured missense variants that fell in a region of LOH in the tumour from the father only, but none showed somatic loss of the wild type allele in the tumour. The REEP5 gene was sequenced in 23 individuals with presumed sporadic AMTs or PMP; no LoF or rare missense germline variants were identified.
CONCLUSION: Germline exome sequencing of a father and daughter with AMTs identified novel candidate predisposing genes. Further studies are required to clarify the role of these genes in familial AMTs.},

  abstract = {RNA has become one of the major research topics in molecular biology. As a central player in key processes regulating gene expression, RNA is in the focus of many efforts to decipher the pathways that govern the transition of genetic information to a fully functional cell. As more and more researchers join this endeavour, there is a rapidly growing demand for comprehensive collections of tools that cover the diverse layers of RNA-related research. However, increasing amounts of data, from diverse types of experiments, addressing different aspects of biological questions need to be consolidated and integrated into a single framework. Only then is it possible to connect findings from e.g. RNA-Seq experiments and methods for e.g. target predictions. To address these needs, we present the RNA Workbench 2.0 , an updated online resource for RNA related analysis. With the RNA Workbench we created a comprehensive set of analysis tools and workflows that enables researchers to analyze their data without the need for sophisticated command-line skills. This update takes the established framework to the next level, providing not only a containerized infrastructure for analysis, but also a ready-to-use platform for hands-on training, analysis, data exploration, and visualization. The new framework is available at https://rna.usegalaxy.eu , and login is free and open to all users. The containerized version can be found at https://github.com/bgruening/galaxy-rna-workbench.},

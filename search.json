Over 1200 developers have contributed software that is downloaded by users over 500K times per year.\nIn April 2020, we established a Community Advisory Board (CAB) that includes elected representatives from America, Europe, Africa, Asia and Latin America to outreach to the growing global Bioconductor community. The CAB identified accessible high-quality training materials and delivery methods as an urgent, impactful need. Fundamental components for a successful training platform include skilled and effective program management, excellence in instruction, quality of training materials and equity in access. This proposal will redevelop the Bioconductor web presence to ensure Bioconductor communities have equitable access to quality, well-structured, project information and training materials. This work will also deliver structured, high-quality, culturally-aware, inclusive global training by developing a platform for community led instruction.\nReimers and Carey (2006)\nOur lab support open source bioinformatics community and are working with European Infrastructure for life-science information (ELIXIR) and LERO’s open source office.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFunding Sources\nThis project is funded by a Chan Zuckerberg Initiative CZI Science Essential Open Source Software (EOSS) award to Aedin Culhane.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nReimers, Mark, and Vincent J.

The overall programme is designed to support the European 1+ Million Genomes (1+MG) Initiative. Specifically, GDI will drive the development, deployment and operation of sustainable data-access infrastructures within each participating country including the legal frameworks, operational procedures and ethics principles required to foster and maintain citizens’ trust in cross-border access to highly sensitive personal data. It will unlock a data network of over 1 million genome sequences for research and clinical reference creating unprecedented opportunities for routine transnational, multi-stakeholder actions in personalised medicine for common, rare and infectious diseases. Authorised data users, such as clinicians, researchers and innovators, will be able to advance our understanding of genomics for more precise and faster clinical decision-making, diagnostics, treatments and predictive medicine, and for improved public health measures that will benefit citizens, healthcare systems and the overall economy. Thus, GDI is a critical component of Europe’s ambition to lead the integration of genomics into healthcare and the GDI project is designed to interact with the other actors working towards this ambition via incremental milestones that drive alignment along a dynamic roadmap.\n\nGDI will lay the foundations for Ireland’s participation in a federated European Infrastructure for genomic data via six related areas of activities;\nActivity 1: Promoting the establishment of the Irish 1+MG National Mirror Group, connecting with and contributing to the European 1+MG initiative. The Irish group will mirror the European-level working groups of the 1+MG, and to connect the relevant Irish-based individuals with those European working groups.\nActivity 2: Developing a national genomics plan for realisation in Ireland of the European 1+MG initiative. This activity would seek to align with the National Strategy for Genetics and Genomics in Ireland, and scope out an impactful and sustainable Irish Genome Project.\nActivity 3: Developing, testing and validating a proof of concept platform for performing distributed analysis, connected to the European Data Network. This would in effect be a pilot Irish node for the federated European system, connecting genomic datasets. UL and the Culhane group are leading activity 3.\nActivity 4: Determining the Irish-specific data governance system needed to enable sustainable and secure sharing of genomic data. This will involve developing data governance practices for privacy protection in a data sharing/federated data environment. It will include public and patient involvement.\nActivity 5: Feasibility study for cross-border (N:S) “Genomes of Ireland” initiative. This will inform a national genomic reference for Ireland.\nActivity 6: Development of training initiatives for the next generation of genomic clinician and data scientists. This will develop training modules/activities that inform clinicians and data scientists, and equip them with the skills and knowledge required to enable safe and effective sharing of genomic data.\nGDI-Ireland is co-led by Prof. Gianpiero Cavalleri (RCSI) and Prof. Denis Shields (UCD). They are joined by co-investigators Prof. Aedin Culhane (University of Limerick) and Prof. Markus Helfert (Maynooth Univerity). The team is assisted by collaborators at University of Galway, UCD, IPPOSI and Health Research Charities Ireland. The project will be governed by a group with cross sectorial (including patient/citizen) representation."

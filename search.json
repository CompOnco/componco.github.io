Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy, which reprograms a patient’s immune system to recognize and attack cancer cells, has shown success in blood cancers but has not yet been translated to solid tumors. The goal of this project is to develop CAR-T cell therapy for kidney cancer by fine-tuning immune CAR-T cells to recognize and eliminate only cancer cells while sparing normal cells.\nWe are analyzing scRNAseq and multi-omics single-cell data generated as part of this project by Dr. Yufei Wang and Prof. Wayne Marasco in The Marasco Laboratory in the Department of Cancer Immunology and Virology at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.\nLearn more with this video."

The overall programme is designed to support the European 1+ Million Genomes (1+MG) Initiative.\n  \n  Specifically, GDI will drive the development, deployment, and operation of sustainable data-access infrastructures within each participating country, including the legal frameworks, operational procedures, and ethics principles required to foster and maintain citizens' trust in cross-border access to highly sensitive personal data.\n  \n  It will unlock a data network of over 1 million genome sequences for research and clinical reference, creating unprecedented opportunities for routine transnational, multi-stakeholder actions in personalised medicine for common, rare, and infectious diseases. Authorised data users, such as clinicians, researchers, and innovators, will be able to advance our understanding of genomics for more precise and faster clinical decision-making, diagnostics, treatments, and predictive medicine, and for improved public health measures that will benefit citizens, healthcare systems, and the overall economy.\n  \n  Thus, GDI is a critical component of Europe's ambition to lead the integration of genomics into healthcare, and the GDI project is designed to interact with the other actors working towards this ambition via incremental milestones that drive alignment along a dynamic roadmap."

Over 1,200 developers have contributed software that is downloaded by users over 500,000 times per year.\nIn April 2020, we established a Community Advisory Board (CAB) that includes elected representatives from America, Europe, Africa, Asia, and Latin America to outreach to the growing global Bioconductor community. The CAB identified accessible high-quality training materials and delivery methods as an urgent, impactful need. Fundamental components for a successful training platform include:\n\nSkilled and effective program management.\nExcellence in instruction.\nQuality of training materials.\nEquity in access.\n\nThis proposal will redevelop the Bioconductor web presence to ensure Bioconductor communities have equitable access to quality, well-structured project information and training materials. This work will also deliver structured, high-quality, culturally-aware, inclusive global training by developing a platform for community-led instruction."
